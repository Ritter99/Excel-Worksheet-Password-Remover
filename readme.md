# Excel Worksheet Password Remover

This project aims to simplify the removal of passwords on Excel's Worksheet by leaving the task of editing the XML files on an Excel document to your browser.

## Preface

This tool is intended to be used with files for which you have the express authorization to remove the password from.<br>
If you don't have said authorisation, you should refer to the proper authority for more information on the matter.<br>
I am only providing a generic tool, you are the one who decides what you do with it and that take the responsability of using it !

**NO DATA IS SENT OVER THE INTERNET** while using this tool as everything is done inside of your browser using JavaScript.<br>
However, for legal reason, you should refrain from using this tool if your file contains sensitive informations unless you have received authorization from the appropriate authorities to avoid any potential legal issue on your side.

This tool **WILL NOT** reveal the original password since they are secured and not stored in clear text, it will only **REMOVE** them.

By using this tool, you accept the entire responsability that comes with using said tool as it is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.
